# FALCON-HEAVY-NIGHTLIGHT-V2
Files for you to create an awesome 3D printed Falcon Heavy Nightlight

I scaled all models up 200%, added magnets and 2x 18650 battery + charge, protect, boost. I programmed Arduino Nano so you can chose from 3 main LED programs or the same, with stronger light. 
Print rocket at 100% infill
Exhaust at 0% infill with 3 perimeters

After printing the rocket I drilled 9mm holes to rocket's bottom so I was able to insert and glue 2 of 8x3mm round magnets inside. 
After all that was done I used various sandpapers, spray filler and white spray to hide all the magnets and layers. 
Next, I've glued magnets with matching pole of magnets on the rocket to exhaust with superglue. 
I tested all the electronics and code on breadboard and after that was done, I soldered everything on piece of prototyping perfboard. 
I set up the battery pack with cheap modules that provided charge protect and boost functions and after testing everything together I noticed that the step-up module was making some quiet, weird sound. 
I tied adding a 100uF 50v capacitor to its output and the noise magically disappeared.
Now I have a very good looking model of Falcon Heavy rocket lighting my room at night.
